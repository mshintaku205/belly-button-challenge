# Belly-Button-Challenge
Module 14 Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is to build a dashboard to display the microbes that colonize in human navels, or belly buttons.

## Objectives
Use the D3 library to read in a JSON format data and create a 

1. Bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs (operational taxonomic units, or microbial species) found in that individual.
2. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
3. Display the sample's metadata, for example, an individual's demographic information by looping each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
